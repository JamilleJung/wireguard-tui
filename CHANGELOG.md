## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- First release: a native Linux **terminal UI** (`wg-tui`) for managing
  WireGuard tunnels, with the same feature set as the desktop client.
- Tunnel list with a live active/inactive indicator and a merged detail view
  (interface + peers), refreshed every second — latest handshake and transfer.
- Activate / Deactivate (`wg-quick up`/`down`).
- Edit a tunnel in `$EDITOR` with config validation; apply live to a running
  tunnel without dropping peers (`wg syncconf`).
- New tunnel from a generated template; **Generate** keypairs + preshared keys
  (`wg genkey`/`genpsk`); **Show running config** (`wg showconf`) and
  **Save live state** (`wg-quick save`).
- Import a `.conf` file or a **QR-code image**; **Show QR** in the terminal;
  **Export** all tunnels to a `.zip`.
- Rename / Remove tunnels; **Start-on-boot** toggle; a **Log** tab.
- **Hardened privileged helper** (`wg-helper`): fixed paths, strict tunnel-name
  validation, atomic writes, timestamped backups, journald audit logging.
- Privilege backends: **sudoers** (default) or **polkit** (`--polkit`); `pkexec`
  fallback. Reuses a co-installed desktop-client helper automatically.
- **Universal installer** (`install.sh`) for apt, dnf/yum, pacman, zypper, apk,
  xbps and eopkg, with a minimal-install dependency check.
